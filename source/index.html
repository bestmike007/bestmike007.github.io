<p>Hi! My name is Yuanhai He, they also call me Mike. <br>I am an Entrepreneur, Product Manager and Software Engineer.</p>

<p>My focus is on full-stack programming for web and mobile applications as well as user experience and building a scalable infrastructure. I am currently working as Backend Engineer at Beego Ltd., Chegndu China. My interests extend into machine learning, big data analysis, cloud computing and team building.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor as well as a Masters in Software Engineer from the <a href="http://software.nju.edu.cn/">Software Institue of Nanjing University</a>. I co-founded the startup Beego, a company that build mobile apps and smart hardware apps in order to encourage everyone to do things well, where I was in charge of building a scalable infrastructure.</p>

<p>I also maintain several open-source projects which, I think, might be helpful to someone else, and I love to contribute to the open source community. I&rsquo;ll keep thinking about the next big thing to change our world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m temporarily based in Chengdu, the biggest software park in the west of China. I am looking for new ideas, like-minded people and also chances to make a change to our world. Feel free to say hi!<br>i `at` bestmike007.com</p>
