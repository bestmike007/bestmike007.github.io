<p>Hi! My name is Yuanhai He, they also call me Mike. <br>I am an Entrepreneur, Product Manager and Software Architect.</p>

<p>My focus is on full-stack programming for web and mobile applications. I care much about user experience and building a scalable infrastructure. I am currently working as a Software Architect at MingChuan Ltd., Pudong Shanghai China. My interests extend into machine learning, big data analysis, cloud computing and high performance & high availability system.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor as well as a Masters in Software Engineer from the <a href="http://software.nju.edu.cn/">Software Institue of Nanjing University</a>. I stick on startups since intership, where I do all kind of technical stuff including building the scalable infrastructure, programming the software system, optimizing the user experiences, etc.</p>

<p>I also maintain several open-source projects which, I think, might be helpful to someone else, and I love to contribute to the open source community. I&rsquo;ll keep thinking about the next big thing to change our world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m based in Pudong, Shanghai for now. I am looking for new ideas, like-minded people and also chances to make a change, even a slight one, to our world. Feel free to say hi!<br>i `at` bestmike007.com</p>
